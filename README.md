# Caesar's Cipher in Ruby ðŸ’Ž
A simple implementation of the Caesar's Cipher written in Ruby programming language.

## Description
The Caesar's Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Usage
To use the code, you can clone this repository and run the file `v2.rb`. You will start the CLI that guide you to the usage and operations possible.

Otherwise, you can just run or add the `caesar_cipher.rb` in your code and call the function as this:
```ruby

caesar_cipher(string, shift_factor, operation)
```
- `string`: the string you want to cipher or decipher
- `shift_factor`: the number of letters you want to shift
- `operation`: the operation you want to do with the string, `1` to cipher and `-1` to decipher
